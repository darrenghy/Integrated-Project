# IP

In this assignment, I made a website for my own personal eCommerce company that I build from scratch, which includes multiple products that my company sells
 
## Design Process
 
- As a client, I would want to know what my company sells, so i can better serve them with a more easy to navigate website, which is why i added features and products that my company has
- I also included a contact page where my clients can reach me
- I also added an About Us page where my client knows what exactly they can expect from my company

## Features

I added a home section where it brings my clients to the top of my website
I added my company slogan and the products my company sells
I added a contact page
 
### Existing Features
- Contact Page - allows users to contact me by submitting a form i made at the bottom of the website, by filling out their name, email and enquiries so i can get back to them with their provided email
